# Logistic Regression Analysis
### Overview
This project used logistic regression to classify whether a home is "luxury" based on property and neighborhood features. It involved cleaning the data, exploring key patterns (EDA), and selecting the most useful features. The model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

### Logistic Regression – Luxury Home Classification
-	Built a logistic regression model to predict if a home is “luxury” using over 12 features like number of bathrooms and nearby amenities
-	Improved accuracy to about 75% using backward stepwise elimination
-	Used EDA and hypothesis testing to guide feature selection and evaluated results with classification metrics
